# anti-cryptosporidial
We  developed an algorithm to quantify the theoretical contributions of on-target and off-target effects to the observed in vitro anti-cryptosporidial activity at the EC50 value and in a full range of anti-cryptosporidial efficacies. This new model and algorithm also open a door for relatively quick development of drug resistance to virtually unlimited classes of compounds including substrates and non-substrates of MDR1 and quantitatively differentiating the contributions of on- and off-target effects to the killing of Cryptosporidium parasites.
